PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
 This project had a HTML, CSS, and JS files. It also had a json file that was warking with the API choosen to fetch the data.


Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.
 This project had only 1 HTML file and did not redirect to any other page like the contact us pae and rather just remained on the same page

Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).
This project contained  3 dom event listenets which included ...
 DOMContentLoaded - (document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {)
 submit- (getElementById('form').addEventListener("display", response))
 click - (addEventListener("click", displayText);
function displayText() {)

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.
There is some interactivity to the page as one is able to enter their email for subscribing to the app and is given an alert once they do so.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
Functions have been used in this case to avoid repetition of the codes.
